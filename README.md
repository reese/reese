### ðŸŒ±ðŸŒ±ðŸŒ±

Hello!
I'm Reese (he/him), a Software Engineer at [Stripe](https://stripe.com), and previously I worked at [HubSpot](https://hubspot.com) and [The Gnar Company](https://thegnar.co).
Outside of my work, I work on various side projects such as [Rox](https://github.com/reese/rox), a toy programming language, and writing articles for my [personal blog](https://reesew.io). I'm really interested in Rust and Ruby (and using them together!) and would love to collaborate on any related projects.
